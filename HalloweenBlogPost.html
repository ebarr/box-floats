  <h2>Pumpkin Everything</h2>

  <p>This time of year, every brand thinks that they need to turn their product into a pumpkin. Not literally a pumpkin but add a pumpkin flavor to it. Some of these products include pumpkin bagels, pumpkin M&Ms, pumpkin beer and cider (which is actually amazing), Pumpkin vodka, pumpkin Pringles, pumpkin ice cream, Pumpkin Pop Tarts and Hershey Kisses.</p>
  <p>I'll just stick to the Pumpkin cider though.</p>

  <h2>Excuse to Carve Pumpkins</h2>

  <p>Halloween gives me an excuse to make Ryan drive me to the suburbs, pick out a pumpkin, drag it up four flights of stairs and then throw it out five days later.</p>
  <p>The only reason why I even like to get the pumpkin is to make pumpkin seeds. Without Halloween, I'd never be able to make pumpkin seeds.</p>

  <p>Every year, you go to someone's house party, to the bars or both. This always provides a lot of entertainment and some awkward conversations. </p>
  <p>Some costumes deserve awards while others shouldn't be legal to wear in public. Either way, it is always memorable.
